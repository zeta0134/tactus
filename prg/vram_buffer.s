; Applies a buffer of PPUDATA writes stored in the stack area, and
; rapidly copies this data. The list should begin with a length byte,
; indicating the number of runs, followed by this 3 byte header:
; - target address (16bit)
; - vram direction and length (1 bit + 7 bits)
; A 1 for vram direction signals +32 mode, otherwise +1 mode is used.

; Note that this function assumes a complete table has been written.
; For safety, the functions which manipulate this table increment length
; last, however it's probably best to avoid calling this function at all
; unless the game loop is complete, otherwise partial transfers may be
; skipped entirely.

; Inputs:
;   Length at $100
;   VRAM Table at $108
;   Fresh brewed Coffee (stronest available)

; Clobbers: A, X PPUCTRL

; By aligning this to 256, we force the pop slide to
; both be on a four byte boundary, and begin at a $xx00 address, which lets us
; use the low byte directly as an offset into the table. We're placing this first
; in the file, to hopefully avoid wasting unnecessary space.
